//? What is Data Structure? and  What is Algorithm?

//* Data Structure are storage models which helps us to store data in efficient manner for diff use cases.
// examples of Data Structure are Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs
// in array we store data in contigous memory locations/linearly.

//* Algorithm are set of steps to solve a problem, or we can say that define steps that helps us to achieve a task in efficient manner.

//------------- Technique [Trick] -------------------
//! Two pointer
// we will be able to apply this technique in Arrays,String, Linked Lists, Stacks, etc and other Data structures
//* MIMP technique which asked in interviews .

//? two pointer name dosent mean u take 2 variables, u can take more than 2 variables

//? prepare 2, to 3 variables and then you place these variables on diff parts of input
// example if we have an array - [1,2,3,4,5] then we can use 2 pointers one at the start of the array and one at the end of the array
// or we can put both 2 pointers on the start of array
// or if we have 3 elemets then, we can put two at the start and one at the end

// now we put these pointers on diff diff positions now we try to move then, so while moving them , we tried to discard somepart of data structure

// to learn this we solve leetcode problem - 344. Reverse String

//------------- Time and Space Complexity Analysis / Algorithym Analysis -------------------

//! Time and Space Complexity Analysis
//* 1) Efficiency of an Algorithym in terms of time taken is important [means how much time it takes to solve the problem]
//* 2) Efficiency of an Algorithym in terms of space/memory taken is important [means how much space/memory it takes to solve the problem]
